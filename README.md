Movie Recommendation System

In today’s world of choices, it is becoming more and more difficult to navigate towards things that we might like. Let’s take an example of movies, when one decides to watch a movie it can get rather frustrating to decide which movie to watch because of the enormous amount of options. Our project aims at alleviating this crisis by providing users with personalized recommendations. Our goal is to develop a cloud-based service which uses Collaborative Filtering Technique with a neighborhood-based approach to help user in his or her decision-making process. Collaborative Filtering focuses on relationships between users and items, which means that the user is not provided recommendations only based on similar object types but also is recommended what similar users have watched. This technique not only personalizes the results further but also helps broaden the scope of the recommendations.
